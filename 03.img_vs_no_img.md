# 🧩 Scenario 1: Image already exists on Docker Hub

If the image is available on Docker Hub (for example: node:18),
you just need to pull it and run it 👇

```bash
# Step 1: Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull node:18

# Step 2: Verify that the image was downloaded
docker images

# Step 3: Run a container using that image
docker run -it node:18

# (Optional) Run in background mode with a name
docker run -d --name my-node-app node:18

# (Optional) List running containers
docker ps

```

✅ That’s it — you pulled an existing image and ran it as a container.

In

```bash
docker pull node:18
```

- node → is the image name
- 18 → is the tag (usually represents version, like Node.js v18)

Together, node:18 refers to a **specific version of the Node.js image on Docker Hub**.

# 🛠 Scenario 2: No image exists on Docker Hub

If there’s no prebuilt image, you’ll need to build one from a Dockerfile and then run it.

Let’s assume your project has a `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

```bash
# Step 1: Build an image from your Dockerfile
docker build -t my-app:latest .

# Step 2: Verify that the image was created
docker images

# Step 3: Run a container using the image you just built
docker run -it my-app:latest

# (Optional) Run in detached mode and expose a port
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-app-container my-app:latest

# (Optional) View running containers
docker ps
```

# 🏷️ What is a Tag in Docker?

A tag in Docker is basically a label or version identifier attached to an image.
It lets you differentiate multiple versions of the same image.

👉 Example:

```bash
node:16
node:18
node:20
```

Here:

- All three are Node.js images,
- But each one represents a different version of Node.js.

## ❓ Is It Necessary to Use a Tag?

- **No, it’s not mandatory.**
  If you don’t specify a tag, Docker automatically uses the default tag:

  ```bash
  :latest
  ```

Example:

```bash
docker pull node
```

is actually the same as:

```bash
docker pull node:latest
```

So it will download whatever version is currently marked as latest on Docker Hub.

## ⚠️ Why You Should Avoid Only Using `latest` in Production

Using latest can be risky because:

- It may **change over time** (e.g., from Node 18 → Node 20).

- Your container might **break unexpectedly** after a rebuild if a newer image version has breaking changes.

✅ Always prefer a **specific tag** like:

```bash
docker pull node:18
```

That way, your environment stays predictable.
