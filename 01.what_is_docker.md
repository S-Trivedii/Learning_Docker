# üê≥ What is Docker?

**_Docker is a platform for building, running, and managing applications inside containers._**

A **_container_** is like a small, lightweight, and isolated box that has **_everything your app needs to run_** ‚Äî code, libraries, dependencies, configuration, etc.

It ensures that your app runs exactly the same way everywhere, no matter where you deploy it ‚Äî your laptop, a server, or the cloud.

# üí° The Problem Docker Solves

Before Docker, developers faced the classic problem:

```txt
‚ÄúIt works on my machine!‚Äù
```

Let‚Äôs see why that happened:

- You might run your app on your laptop with Node.js 18, but the production server has Node.js 16.
- Your backend depends on MongoDB 7.0, but the tester‚Äôs environment uses 6.0.
- You installed dependencies in a certain way that others didn‚Äôt.

Different environments = Different results ‚ö†Ô∏è

# ‚úÖ How Docker Solves It

Docker solves this by **_packaging your app and all its dependencies into a container image._**

`That image can run anywhere ‚Äî it‚Äôs portable and consistent.`

You just need Docker installed, and then you can run:

```bash
docker run my-app
```

and it will work **_exactly the same way_** everywhere.

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è How Docker Works (Simplified)

1. **_Dockerfile_** ‚Üí A text file that describes how to build your app image (what to install, what command to run).

2. **Docker Image** ‚Üí A snapshot (blueprint) built from the Dockerfile.

3. **Docker Container** ‚Üí A running instance of that image (your app actually running).

4. **Docker Engine** ‚Üí The software that runs and manages containers.

```mathematica
Dockerfile ‚Üí Image ‚Üí Container
```

# Example (without a dockerfile or without an image)

## If my laptop or system has a project called X but it didn't have dependency and other thing to run the project X. Then how docker helps. Explain ?

Since your system only has a project called X, then there are two ways to run your project.

### 1. Download all dependency or project requirement locally in your system to run project X.

If you follow this approach then you have to download/install everything for project X which is really cumbersome.

If your friend need to run the same project then you have to download/install the same thing in your friend system over and over again.

Docker solve this problem.

### 2. Second approach - using Docker

‚öôÔ∏è **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **You create a Dockerfile**

This file describes how to set up the environment for Project X.

Example (for a Node.js app):

```dockerfile
# Use a ready-made image that already has Node installed
FROM node:18

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your project files into the container
COPY . .

# Install dependencies inside the container
RUN npm install

# Start the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ **You build the Docker image**

This creates a package of your app + all dependencies inside a container image.

```bash
docker build -t project-x .
```

Now, this image has:

- Node.js 18
- All npm packages from package.json
- Your project files
- A start command

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ **You run it as a container**

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 project-x
```

Docker will:

- Create a mini isolated environment (container)
- Run your project inside it
- Map port 3000 of container ‚Üí your laptop‚Äôs port 3000

Even though your laptop **doesn‚Äôt have Node.js installed,**
your app runs perfectly because Node.js **exists inside the container.**

---

### Minor things to remember

üÖ∞Ô∏è **Case 1: If company provides you a dockerfile**

Some time company provides you a `dockerfile`, then you need to build a **Docker image**. When you execute a `docker run` command using a specific image, Docker creates a new, runnable instance of that image. This instance is called a container. The container provides an isolated environment where the application defined in the image can execute.

---

üÖ±Ô∏è **Case 2: If company provides you a docker image**

A ready-made Docker image uploaded to a registry (like Docker Hub or a private server).

If they already provide an image, you can just pull and run it:

```bash
docker pull company/project-x
docker run -p 3000:3000 company/project-x
```

---

**Case 3: You create yourself**

If the company just gives you the raw project files (like source code) ‚Äî
then you **create the Dockerfile yourself** to define how to build the container.

You write instructions like:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Then you build and run:

```bash
docker build -t project-x .
docker run -p 3000:3000 project-x
```

‚úÖ This way, you create the container environment from scratch.

---

### Understanding above two commands

First:

```bash
docker build -t project-x
```

- `docker build`: The command that tells the Docker daemon to build a new image.
- `-t`: The shorthand flag for --tag, which is used to assign a name
- `project-x`: The name given to the image

---

Second:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 project-x
```

- `docker run`: The command that instructs the Docker daemon to create a new container.
- `-p 3000:3000`: The "publish" flag, which maps a port from the host machine to a port inside the container.
  1.  The first 3000 is the host port.
  2.  The second 3000 is the container port.
- `project-x`: The name of the Docker image to be used as the blueprint for the new container.
