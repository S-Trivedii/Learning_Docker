# 🚀 Publish Docker Image to Docker Hub

This guide explains how to publish your Docker image to Docker Hub, so others (or you) can easily pull and run it anywhere.

---

## 🧩 1. Create a Docker Hub Account

- Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
- Sign up or log in to your existing account.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Log In from Terminal

Run the following command:

```bash
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub username and password (or access token) when prompted.

If login is successful, you’ll see:

```nginx
Login Succeeded
```

---

## 🏗️ 3. Build Your Docker Image If It Doesn't Exist

Make sure you have a valid Dockerfile in your project directory.

Then, build your image:

```bash
docker build -t username/repository-name:tag .
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker build -t shubhanshu/expressapp:latest .
```

📝 Note:

- `username` → **your Docker Hub username**
- `repository-name` → **the name of your Docker Hub repository**
- `tag` → **optional version tag (default: latest)**

---

## 🚀 4. Push Image to Docker Hub

Use the following command to upload your image:

```bash
docker push username/repository-name:tag
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker push shubhanshu/expressapp:latest
```

Docker will upload all image layers to your repository.

---

## ✅ 5. Verify on Docker Hub

1. Visit Docker Hub

2. Navigate to your profile → Repositories

3. You should now see your uploaded image listed.

---

## 🧰 6. Pull the Image from Anywhere

Once published, you (or others) can pull the image using:

```bash
docker pull username/repository-name:tag
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker pull shubhanshu/expressapp:latest
```

Now you can run the image on any system without rebuilding it.
